# Wetland_UNet
This repo provides complete script used for wetland mapping (delineation of boundaries) using UNet, an architecture developed out of deep-learning model. The input variables comprise of multiple bands of Sentinel-2 and of NAIP. We have also trained a more complex model that includes LiDAR and geomorphons.
